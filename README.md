# Sensors data

Records cpu temperatures to JSON in the /data folder. 

# Usage

`./run.sh`

failed.log isn't very interesting, and isn't a log

If you want to see data going into the file live, then open up another terminal window and do `tail -f path/to/file`

# Python migration

I'm moving to a python cli style utility - it will be better - progress is being made.
